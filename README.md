This is a adoption of the **vaadin** tutorial explained [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/introduction/tutorial-get-started.html). 

The original application can be found [here](https://github.com/vaadin/flow-and-components-documentation/tree/master/tutorial-getting-started).

The application was adopted in two respects:
* Java code was converted to groovy (quick and dirty)
* instead of maven gradle is used
